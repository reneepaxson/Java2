# Java2
This repository is a collection of all the projects from Sinclair's second java course, CIS 2217, completed in the fall of 2021. Much of this draws from Apache commons CLI. Any code not written by me is credited in the comments.

Most of the code I wrote is under `/src/edu/institution`. The majority of the files are dedicated to creating faux LinkedIn functionality, except for `midterm` and `finalproj`. The midterm project deals with a json Bill of Materials file, reading the items into the program and calculating the total price of all the individual components combined. The final project is an anagrammer that takes a command line text input and returns a list of all possible combinations of the word, with an option to compare the input to a text file of known words.
